In order to run the web application follow the following steps:
1. Open an integrated terminal or command line inside the folder where your files are placed (path of terminal should be set to your folder).
2. Run command 'npm install' in the terminal, this will install all the required dependency libraries (listed in the package.json file) to execute the code.
3. After installations are finished, run command 'nodemon app' in the terminal
This will intialize the application locally in your machine on port number 3000.
(Note: Kindly make sure that port number 3000 is not already in use. Have an active internet connection to connect with the virtual database successfully.)
4. Go to your preferred browser ( which supports NodeJs) and type in address bar 'localhost:3000/' to land on the homepage of the web application.
